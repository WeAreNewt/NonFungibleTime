# Non Fungible Time

{% hint style="info" %}
Non Fungible Time is a Proof Of Concept
{% endhint %}

### Web3 Is Empowering

In Web 2, reputations are limited to the platforms they are built on. Employment history is owned by the employer. The collateral you can demand against your future production is subject to bias.

By tokenizing your time, you hold the title to your work history. It is immutably recorded. Your reputation is dictated by the amount and quality of your work and no single intermediary can prevent your promotion or financing.&#x20;

Delivering top quality work and high levels of production is a virtuous cycle with Non Fungible Time and _only you can define your own limitations_.

### The 3 Primary Branches Of The WorkFi Economy

Non Fungible Time is a WorkFi primitive. The functions are stripped down to their most basic attributes. They are a universal format for exchanging human collateral on a decentralized network. Developers can build applications on top of the primitive to mint and exchange time in dynamic ways that serves any unique use case, while workers can move their minted time

**1) Minting** platforms that workers use to represent their time as a Non Fungible Token.

> Examples: DAO Contributors, Consultants,  Engineers, Designers, Professionals.
>
> _Produce a non fungible token that secures your service._

**2) Markets** that connect buyers with minters of time

> Examples: DAO Services Market, Rideshare/Delivery Apps, Professional Scheduling &#x20;
>
> _Deliver the best matching experience to customers with while optimizing labor utility_

**3) Collateral** solutions for producers of time and yield opportunities for liquidity providers.

> Examples: Lending and Borrowing, Insurance Products, Aggregated Labor &#x20;
>
> _Smart contracts that allocate time efficiently and maximize its value._
