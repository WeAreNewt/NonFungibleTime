Some questions to address:

- Will this change require a modification to the smart contracts?
  - A good idea would be to check the [subgraph playground](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/wearenewt/non-fungible-time-mumbai) to see if the required data fields already exist
- Will a design be required for frontend changes?

<br />
