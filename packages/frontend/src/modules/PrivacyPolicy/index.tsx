                The General Data Protection Regulations in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom (“GDPR”) distinguish 
                between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as “controllers”) and organizations 
                that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as “processors”). We act as a controller with 
                respect to personal data collected as you interact with the Services.

              <p>
                The GDPR requires a “lawful basis” for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given 
                consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; 
                (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance 
                with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a 
                third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. Where applicable, we 
                will transfer your personal data to third parties subject to appropriate or suitable safeguards, such as standard 
                contractual clauses.

              <p>
                If you are a user in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you maintain certain rights under the GDPR. 
                These rights include the right to (i) request access and obtain a copy of your personal data; (ii) request 
                rectification or erasure of your personal data; (iii) object to or restrict the processing of your personal data; 
                and (iv) request portability of your personal data. Additionally, if we have collected and processed your personal 
                data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, we cannot edit or delete information that is stored on a particular blockchain. 
                This information may include transaction data (i.e., purchases, sales, and transfers) related to your blockchain wallet 
                address and any NFTs held by your wallet address. 
              </p>

                above and specify which right you are seeking to exercise. We will respond to your request within thirty (30) days. 
                We may require specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Please note 
                that we retain information as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected and may continue to retain 
                and use information even after a data subject request in accordance with our legitimate interests, including as 
                necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements.
