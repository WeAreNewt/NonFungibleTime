          </h2>
          <h3><b>All transactions and interactions are between or among users. </b></h3>
          <p>
            We make the Services available for users to (a) mint and sell Time NFTs and (b) find and purchase Time NFTs. 
            We have no control over whether any Time NFT is offered and/or accepted as this is entirely at the discretion of the users.  
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not have the ability to – and do not – introduce users to each other or select Time NFTs for any user. 
            Through the Site, users may purchase Time NFTs; however, users are responsible for evaluating and determining 
            the suitability of any Time NFT on their own.  
          </p>
          <p>
            If a user decides to purchase a Time NFT, any agreement in relation to the Time NFT is formed directly between the users 
            and we are not a party to it. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to or should be construed to create a partnership, 
            joint venture, franchisor/franchisee or other relationship between us and any user. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By minting the Time NFT, the offering user describes the type of service or activity they are offering. 
            The offering user determines the terms, conditions, and limitations of the Time NFT. The offering user may 
            additionally include fees on secondary sales of the Time NFT.
          </p>
          <h3><b>We do not vouch for or guarantee the quality or deliverables of any services or activity represented by a Time NFT.</b></h3>
          <p>
            We do not vouch for or have anything to do with the services or activities underlying the Time NFT and thus, do not guarantee that the Time NFTs or the corresponding services or activities:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              are error free; 
            </li>
            <li>
              fully address or meet the user’s expectations;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide a complete set of deliverables;
            </li>
            <li>
              are of a standard consistent with any level of expertise;
            </li>
            <li>
              are provided at a fair or reasonable price; 
            </li>
            <li>
              are achievable in the provided time or at all; 
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3><b>We do not guarantee the value of Time NFTs.</b></h3>
          <p>
            Time NFTs are sold at a fixed price determined by the offeror and for any secondary sale at a price determined solely by 
            the holder of such Time NFT. Subject to market conditions, including but not limited to, as supply and demand of 
            various services, the value of any Time NFT might be impacted. The blockchain ecosystem in general could be negatively 
            impacted by regulatory inquiries, regulatory actions, legislation, or court rulings, among other things. A Time NFT’s 
            market value could also decline in light of copyright or trademark claims against the use of any deliverable associated 
            with the Time NFT.
          </p>
          <p>
            We make no representation or warranty that the price of any Time NFT sold or offered for sale on or off of the Site is 
            fair or reasonable. We disclaim any obligation to ensure that Time NFTs sold on or through our Services are priced fairly. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Use of the Services, including to mint, buy or sell Time NFTs or other digital assets, carries material financial risk. 
            Blockchain-based transactions involving cryptocurrency and digital assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, 
            risky, volatile, and speculative, and the risk of material or total loss is substantial. 
          </p>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services, including, without limitation, the Site, Time NFTs, 
            and their underlying smart contracts, at your own risk. You should not use the Services to engage in blockchain-based 
            transactions unless it is suitable given your circumstances and financial resources. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By using the Services, you represent that you have been, are and will be solely responsible for conducting your own due 
            diligence into the risks of a transaction and the underlying digital assets.  
          </p>
          <h3><b>There may be associated blockchain fees.</b></h3>
          <p>
            All transactions using the Ethereum blockchain require the payment of gas fees, which are essentially transaction fees paid 
            on every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum network. This includes transactions initiated using the Services. 
            Please note that gas fees are non-refundable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              Users must hold sufficient funds in their linked digital wallet to cover the initiated transaction for, including but not 
              limited to, minting a Time NFT, purchasing a Time NFT, reselling a Time NFT, as well as any associated gas fees, 
              to complete a transaction. 
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not provide escrow services to users or deliver, hold, and/or receive payment for Time NFTs. We do not receive any 
            fees for any Time NFT, the Services, or the Site.  
          </p>
          <h3><b>Disputes between users </b></h3>
          <p>
            For disputes arising between or among users relating to a Time NFT, the users shall pursue disputes independently between and
            amongst themselves. You acknowledge and agree that we will not and are not obligated to provide any assistance and will 
            not be involved in any way. We are not responsible for any services or activities offered through the Time NFTs or 
            otherwise on the Site. Users acknowledge that we, for the avoidance of doubt, do not have any information regarding any 
            Time NFT, users, users’ identities, or services beyond what is available or obtainable publicly via the blockchain.

          <h3><b>Offerors may use the Services to mint their Time NFTs.</b></h3>
          <p>
            Offerors or offering users, as used in these Terms, are those who mint Time NFTs for sale on the Site.  
          </p>
          <p>
            By minting a Time NFT, an offeror undertakes to dedicate a certain amount of time for rendering a service or activity 
            and guarantees that it has sufficient permissions, rights and/or licenses to provide, sell or resell the service or 
            activity offered.<b> A user will not be able to mint a Time NFT if the digital wallet that they have connected to the 
            Site contains insufficient funds to cover the price of minting the Time NFT. </b>
          </p>
          <h3><b>Offerors of Time NFTs are independent from us.</b></h3>
          <p>
            If you offer Time NFTs, you acknowledge, agree, and understand that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              you are not our employee, agent, contractor or associated with us in any way and you are not eligible for 
              any of the rights or benefits of employment (including unemployment and/or workers compensation insurance) from us; 
            </li>
            <li>
              we will not have any liability or obligations, including under or related to any Time NFT for any acts or omissions by you or other users;

            <li>
              we do not set or have any control over your pricing, hours, schedules, or location, nor are we involved in any 
              other way in determining the nature and amount of any compensation that may be charged by or paid to you;
            </li>
            <li>
              you will be paid at such times and amounts as minted to the Time NFT, and we do not, in any way, provide or guarantee you any payment; 
            </li>

              we do not provide shipping for services related to a Time NFT for any physical work product.  
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3><b>Offerors determine the conditions relating to any Time NFT.</b></h3>
          <p>
            By minting a Time NFT, a user is responsible for determining the type of service or activity offered as well as 
            the conditions for providing such services or activity associated with the Time NFT. Subject to any service, 
            offerors owe a duty to the purchaser to devote reasonable efforts, including time, knowledge, skill, attention, 
            and care to the provision of the services or activity.  
          </p>
          <p>
            If any users enter into any additional written agreements relating to a Time NFT (e.g., confidentiality, invention 
            assignment, assignment of rights, etc.), such agreements shall be binding on such users and do not create 
            obligations for us. An additional agreement outside the Time NFT might not be binding after a resale of the Time NFT.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Offerors must have all necessary rights and licenses to perform services.</b></h3>
          <p>
            Offerors represent and warrant that they hold all rights, licenses, authorizations, and power necessary to perform or 
            grant the rights to any services underlying a Time NFT. You agree that any such service or activity will 
            not violate the copyright, trademark, right of publicity (e.g., image, likeness, persona, performance, signature, 
            voice or other indicia), or other proprietary rights of any third party. Any Time NFT that incorporates the works or 
            personas of others must have been created with the necessary permission, constitute fair use, or otherwise have a valid legal footing for such use.
          </p>
          <h3><b>Offerors may include a royalty condition for the resale of Time NFTs.</b></h3>
          <p>
            The Newt: Aika smart contracts contain a resale royalty component whereby an offeror can include conditions to 
            automatically receive a defined portion of future sales of the Time NFT. As the resale royalty is built into the 
            smart contract, once the Time NFT is sold, the offeror will automatically receive the preset compensation directly 
            to a wallet address indicated by them. The amount of royalty and the wallet address of receiving those fees is solely 
            determined by the offeror.

          <h3><b>Users may use the Services to purchase the Time NFTs. </b></h3>
          <p>
            You should do your own research prior to purchasing a Time NFT. We do not check or make representations or guarantees 
            regarding any Time NFT or any user. If you decide to purchase a Time NFT, the agreement is directly between the 
            offeror and you, and we are not a party to that agreement. 
          </p>
          <p>
            By minting a Time NFT, a user agrees to dedicate a certain time period for rendering the service to you. 
            You agree to pay the offeror based on the time spent, and not on the real or perceived quality of any 
            deliverables provided. For example, if an offeror agrees to offer a 1-hour Time NFT to sketch a portrait of you, 
            you accept that the quality of the work is subject to the offeror’s abilities and any conditions of the Time NFT. 
            You should always evaluate first if the time subject to the Time NFT will be sufficient to deliver the results you desire, 
            taking into account the level of expertise, knowledge, and skill of the offeror. By purchasing a Time NFTs you acknowledge 
            and agree that you are only purchasing the Time NFT for the services or activities underlying the Time NFTs and for no other 
            reason.

            Ownership in and to any materials and or deliverables, as well as any intellectual property rights to any work product

          </p>

            When redemption of a Time NFT involves an offeror creating custom work (such as artwork, design work, written code,

            An offeror may indicate in the description of the Time NFT if the rights to the underlying work product are provided

            <u><b>Assumption of the Risk</b></u>
          </h2>
          <h3><b>We are a non-custodial Site, which means we do not custody any Time NFTs, or funds or provide escrow services. </b></h3>
          <p>
            It is important to understand that transactions using the Services occur directly between or among users; we are not a 
            party to the transaction; we do not have possession, custody or control over the Time NFTs appearing on the Services; 
            and we do not have possession, custody, or control over any user’s funds. Further, we do not store, send, or receive any 
            Time NFTs. 
          </p>
          <h3><b>Transactions on the blockchain are not anonymous.</b></h3>
          <p>
            A widespread belief is that transactions involving blockchains (including NFTs) are anonymous. In fact, a central 
            feature of blockchains and thus, blockchain-based transactions are that they are transparent. Your public key and your 
            wallet address, which you need to buy or sell items on the blockchain, are visible to anyone. To the extent your public 
            key or wallet address can be linked back to you, it would be possible for someone to determine your identity and know or 
            Time NFTs you own. 
          </p>
          <h3><b>You assume the risks of engaging in transactions that rely on smart contracts and other experimental technology.</b></h3>
          <p>
            Transactions enabled by the Services, including minting, buying, and selling Time NFTs, rely on smart contracts 
            stored on the Polygon blockchain, cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and other nascent software and 
            applications. These technologies are experimental, speculative, inherently risky, and subject to change. Among other 
            risks, bugs, malfunctions, cyberattacks, or changes to the Polygon blockchain (e.g., forks) could disrupt these 
            technologies and even result in a total loss of NFTs, their market value, or digital funds. You are solely responsible 
            for the safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain address used to interact with the Services. 
            We assume no liability or responsibility for any such risks. If you are not comfortable assuming these risks, you should 
            not access or engage in transactions using the Services. 
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the other defining features of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable, which means, as a 
            technical matter, they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone. This includes smart contracts 
            and Time NFT generated and programmed by smart contracts. THUS, TRANSACTIONS RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN, 
            INCLUDING TRANSFERS OF TIME NFTS AND DATA PROGRAMMED INTO TIME NFTS (SUCH AS REVENUE AND INTEREST ALLOCATIONS), 
            MUST BE TREATED AS PERMANENT AND CANNOT BE UNDONE BY US OR BY ANYONE. YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL WHEN YOU 
            FINALIZE ANY TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE RECORDED ON THE BLOCKCHAIN. 
          </p>
          <h3><b>We are not liable for any third-party services.</b></h3>
          <p>
            We are not responsible for the content or services of any third party, including, without limitation, any network, or 
            apps like Discord, or MetaMask, and we make no representations regarding the content or accuracy of any third party 
            services or materials. The use and access of any third-party products or services, including through the Services, 
            is at your own risk.
          </p>
          <h3><b>You agree to the automated collection and disbursement of proceeds by smart contracts.</b></h3>
          <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that all transactions accessed through the Services will be automatically processed using 
            one or more blockchain-based smart contracts. By engaging in transactions using the Services, you acknowledge 
            and consent to the automatic processing of all transactions, including for the purchase and sale of Time NFTs 
            using the Services. You further acknowledge and agree that the applicable smart contract will dictate how the 
            funds of a transaction and ownership of a Time NFT are distributed. 
          </p>
          <h3><b>You acknowledge the risks of using the Services.</b></h3>
          <p>
            You bear sole responsibility for evaluating the Services before using them, and all transactions accessed through 
            the Services are irreversible, final, and without refunds. The Services may be disabled, disrupted or adversely 
            impacted as a result of sophisticated cyber-attacks, surges in activity, computer viruses, and/or other

          <p>
            PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY: IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT 
            IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION 
            WAIVER.

          <h3><u>Agreement to Attempt to Resolve Disputes Through Good Faith Negotiations</u></h3>
          <p>
            Prior to commencing any legal proceeding against us of any kind, including an arbitration as set forth below, 
            you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any dispute, claim, or controversy between us arising out of or 
            relating to the agreement or the Services (each, a “Dispute” and, collectively, “Disputes”) by engaging in good 
            faith negotiations. Such good faith negotiations require, at a minimum, that the aggrieved party provide a written 
            notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the Dispute. The party receiving such notice shall 
            have thirty (30) days to respond to the notice. Within sixty (60) days after the aggrieved party sent the initial 
            notice, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith by videoconference, or by telephone, to try to resolve the 
            Dispute. If the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute within ninety (90) days after the aggrieved party sent the 
            initial notice, the parties may agree to mediate their Dispute, or either party may submit the Dispute to arbitration 
            as set forth below.
          </p>
          <h3><u>Agreement to Arbitrate</u></h3>
          <p>
            You and we agree that any Dispute that cannot be resolved through the procedures set forth above will be resolved 
            through binding arbitration in accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the International Centre 
            for Dispute Resolution. The place of arbitration shall be the Cayman Islands. The language of the arbitration 
            shall be English. The arbitrator(s) shall have experience adjudicating matters involving Internet technology, 
            software applications, financial transactions and, ideally, blockchain technology. The arbitrator’s award of 
            damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” subsection of these Terms as to the 
            types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The prevailing party will be entitled to an 
            award of their reasonable attorney’s fees and costs. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor its 
            representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior 
            written consent of (all/both) parties. 
          </p>
          <p>
            UNLESS YOU TIMELY PROVIDE US WITH AN ARBITRATION OPT-OUT NOTICE (AS DEFINED BELOW IN THE SUBSECTION TITLED 
            “YOUR CHOICES”), YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR 
            TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. 
            FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND WE OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE 
            PERSON’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
          </p>
          <h3><u>Changes </u></h3>

            with the provisions of this section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes 
            to these Terms).
