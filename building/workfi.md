### Forking the primitive minting tool

The minting contract serves as primitive layer for minting time. It was built by the experiments lab at Aave and is designed to act as a universal format of collateral.

By forking the initial primitive, builders can add any level of complexity they require.

* Dynamic timing
* Flash interactions
* Custom reputation attributes

### Forking the primitive market place

The market serves as proof of concept layer for trading time. It was built by the experiments lab at Aave and is designed as a means of exchange for layer 1 time primitives.

By forking the marketplace, builders can add any level of complexity they require.

* Product specific user interfaces
* Web 2 integrations
* Supply and demand matching algorithms
